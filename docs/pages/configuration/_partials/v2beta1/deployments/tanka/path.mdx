Path is the (relative) path of the tanka environment, usually identified by jsonnetfile.json. It can be ommited if environmentPath is set and is also relative to the working directory (Tanka's project directory tree). If omitted, Devspace will traverse in reverse environmentPath looking for jsonnetfile.json, when found, that will be set as Path. Otherwise will throw an error.
